On October 20, I offered a bounty ([text](https://hatryx-lastud.tlon.network/newsletter/the-truth-about-all-crucial-things-is-presented-between-the-lines), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud-FZEUtC5M&feature=youtu.be)) for an Urbit app that could serve any arbitrary HTML to the normie web.

I said we'd move fast, no bureaucracy.

On October 21, I received a DM from ~hanfel-dovned.

The app was built.

(Soon) Get the %page app at ~dister-hatryx-lastud/page.
